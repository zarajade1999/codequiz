# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
My motivation for this project was to build a quiz using Javascript using a timer.

- Why did you build this project? 
I built this to showcase everything i have learnt in the past week in classes including "local storage", "Javascript Object Notation" (eg parse and strinify). 

- What problem does it solve?
It solves the problem of not being able to move onto the next page after completing a question and also being able to see if the answer was correct or incorrect. The project solves the problem of the timer going down and stopping at 0 but also going down by 5 numbers if the person gets the answer wrong.

- What did you learn?
I learnt how to structure my functions appropriately according to the task.
